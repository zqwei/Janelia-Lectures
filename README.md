5. Data projection
6. Filtering
7. Normalization
8. Marker genes
9. Clustering and population discovery
10. Differential expression
11. Cross-validation
12. End-to-end: reproducing of cell-type classification
13. Combining two datasets

### Notebooks
* Exercise: sections 1-3
* Exercise\_sc: sections 4 - 

### Tricks
* Supported date file: excel (blank as missing data), tab (? as missing data), csv, google sheets
* Density plot: scatter plot â€”> class density
* One cannot do cluster on t-SNE plots (overfitting etc.).
