## What were some of the hardest concept for you for your peers to learn about in introductory biology?

* Boring
* Long description
* Hard to visualize
* Abstract
* No framework
* Lack of motivation

## Work in group 3-4 to develop a list of features of why some concepts were so difficult to learn; come up with a list of 3-4 features of effective instruction and why you think these are effective features

* Engangement
* Passionate
* Real world application
* Context
* Feedback (immediate and personalized)
* Logical structure
* Playing with ideas in different ways
* Procting in different ways

## General findings:
* Prior knowledge shapes learning
* Experts organize knowledge and approach problems differently from novices
    * What is an activity or task in which you are an expert?
    * How did you get that way?
* Metacognition can help students learn
    * For each question missed, identify and explan the mistake
* Another major factor: student motivation to learn
    * Motivation predictors (expectancy, value, cost)
    * Achievement outcomes (grade, future interests)
    * Expectancy-Value Theory **EVT**
        * promote expectancy (clear goal of the task)
        * promote value (academic interests, future course taking and career aspirations and achievement)
    * Motivation = Expectancy + Value - Cost
    * 5E principals:
        * Engage (create interest and motivation, assess current understanding)
        * Explore (prior knowledge)
        * Explore (students apply their understanding by detecting patterns, generalizing from specific cases, analyzing data etc to help formalize their understanding)
        * Elaborate (broaden or deepen students understanding, apply explanations, practice in new situations)
        * Evaluate (students assess themselves by synthesizing multiple lines of evidence, draw conclusions, can be used summarizably)
